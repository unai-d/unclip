# Unclip
Unclip is a Clip Studio Paint (CSP) project file reader capable of extracting its layers to individual PNG files.

Apart from being a library, it also includes a basic GTK front-end for those that don't want to use the command line interface.

## Requirements

Unclip requires .NET Core 6.0 or later installed on your system.

Unclip is still very barebones and some functionality may not work properly.

## Building and running

- To build the project, do <code>dotnet build</code>.
- To run the project, do <code>dotnet run</code>.
